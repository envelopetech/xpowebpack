                                <p className={classshared.marginbottomm}>PII is information that personally identifies one individual from another. You voluntarily provide this information to us when you create an account to use the Service to attend on of our virtual Events.  When you create an account, we ask you to provide us with the following elements of PII:  (i) Name; (ii) Company Name; (iii) Position; (iv) Address; (v) Telephone Number; and (vi) Email Address.  We will also ask you to provide payment information in order to purchase a ticket to the Event you’ve selected.  Once your account is established, you may add additional information to enhance your profile, such as a photo, your particular interests, and other information.  Any information you elect to add to your profile is entirely voluntary, but will be viewable by other users.
</p>

                                <p className={classshared.marginbottomm}>If you access the Service via the Site, we will record your computer IP address, and may tie it to your specific account. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not PII under the standard definition of the term.  However, it may become PII when it is combined with other information, as in this case <br /><br />

    If you utilize the App, we will record your unique device identifier (or "Unique Device ID"), which is an alpha-numeric string of data that can either be part of the hardware of your device or automatically assigned to your device by the operating system or software.  When you log on to your account, we will record your Unique Device ID and may tie it to your specific account. As with an IP address, a Unique Advice ID recorded in isolation is not PII under the standard definition of the term.  However, it may become PII when it is combined with other information, as in this case. </p>
